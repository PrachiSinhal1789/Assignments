    "\n",
    "Ans:Expressions are made up of values,variables and operators.\n",
    "    Expressions give a value eg (2+7) will give 9  \n",

    "expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:An expression is a logical combination of values,variables and operators whereas when this expression is stored to a variable it is called a statement\n",
    "eg (2+5) is an expression stored as\n",
