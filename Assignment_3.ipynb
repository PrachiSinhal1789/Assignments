    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:We can call function multiple times and dont need to write the code again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The code in a function runs when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: eg. \n",
    "    def my_func():\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "        \n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:In a function we write the required code and when we call the function the code runs and returns value\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Variables defined in the main body of the program \n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Yes the value of the local variable can be returned but the local variable cant be used outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:return value is basically any value given by a function call.\n",
    "    yes we can have a return value in an expression.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:None\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: We can pass the global variable during function call\n",
    "    eg global_var=10\n",
    "       def my_func(local_var)\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "       my_func(global)\n",
    "       \n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Nonetype\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:This statement will help us importing the module areallyourpetsnamederic and then we can use the features and libraries inside that module.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:We use the try and except statements to handle exceptions. Whenever the code breaks down, an exception is thrown without crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Try clause helps to handle run time error,if there is any run time error the rest of the codes will run,it wont get blocked.\n",
    "When there is run time error in the block of code of try block except clause block executes."
