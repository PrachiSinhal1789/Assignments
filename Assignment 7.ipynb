    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.re.compile()\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.So that back slash is not escaped\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.if substring is found then it returns the index else returns none\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Import the regex module with import re.\n",
    "Create a Regex object with the re.compile() function. (Remember to use a raw string.)\n",
    "Pass the string you want to search into the Regex object’s search() method. This returns a Match object.\n",
    "Call the Match object’s group() method to return a string of the actual matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "eg.import re\n",
    "phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)')\n",
    "mo = phoneNumRegex.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')\n",
    "print(mo.group(1))\n",
    "\n",
    "output:'415'\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.group(0) will return the entire string that matches\n",
    "    group(1) will return the first group of string that matches i.e(\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "    group(2) will return the second group of string that matches i.e(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "     \n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.We can use backslash \\( , \\) , \\.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Whenever match is found it returns a list of string.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "Ans. | means or\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Character means any character except those having special meaning match themselves in the given string.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. * indicates the preceding character must match 0 or multiple times\n",
    "     + indicates the preceding character must match 1 or multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. {4} searches for a string of length 4\n",
    "     {4,5} searches for a string of length 4 or 5\n",
    "     \n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \\d looks for a digit, \\w looks for alphabet or digit and \\s looks for space.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\\D looks for any character except digit, \\W looks for any special character other than alphabet or digit and \\S looks for any character other than space.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*   ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  .* matches group 0 whereas .*? captures every character including ''\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. re.findall(r'[a-z0-9]','kjhuyf tyf8775hj gjh')\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regex case insensitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Using re.IGNORECASE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. . captures any character except new line character\n",
    "     re.DOTALL matches all characters including new line character \n",
    "\n",
    "18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.It allows to write regular expressions that look nicer and are more readable by allowing you to visually separate logical sections of the pattern and add comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:\n",
    "'42'\n",
    "'1,234'\n",
    "'6,368,745'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'12,34,567' (which has only two digits between the commas)\n",
    "'1234' (which lacks commas)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "s='12,34,567'\n",
    "s1='6,368,745'\n",

    "s3='1,234'\n",
    "m=re.findall(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})',s3)\n",
    "if m!=[]:\n",
    "    print(s3)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('no match')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:\n",
    "'Haruto Watanabe'\n",
    "'Alice Watanabe'\n",
    "'RoboCop Watanabe'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'haruto Watanabe' (where the first name is not capitalized)\n",
    "'Mr. Watanabe' (where the preceding word has a nonletter character)\n",
    "'Watanabe' (which has no first name)\n",
    "'Haruto watanabe' (where Watanabe is not capitalized)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "s1='Alice Watanabe'\n",
    "s2='haruto Watanabe'\n",
    "s3='Haruto watanabe'\n",
    "ob=re.compile(r'[A-Z]\\w+\\sWatanabe')\n",
    "m=ob.search(s1)\n",
    "print(m.group())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
    "'Alice eats apples.'\n",
    "'Bob pets cats.'\n",
    "'Carol throws baseballs.'\n",
    "'Alice throws Apples.'\n",
    "'BOB EATS CATS.'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'RoboCop eats apples.'\n",
    "'ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'\n",
    "'Carol eats 7 cats.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "s1='BOB EATS CATS.'\n",
    "s2='ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'\n",
    "s3='Carol eats 7 cats.'\n",
    "ob=re.compile(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\\s+(eats|pets|throws)\\s+(apples\\.|cats\\.|baseballs\\.)',re.IGNORECASE)\n",
