       "'P R E F A C E\\nWhy a new book ?\\nExcellent books exist on physics at an introductory college level so why a new one ? Why so many books\\nexist at the same level, in the first place, and why each of them is highly appreciated ? It is because each of\\nthese books has the privilege of having an author or authors who have experienced  physics and have their own\\nmethod of communicating with the students. During my years as a physics teacher, I have developed a somewhatdifferent methodology of presenting physics to the students. Concepts of Physics is a translation of this\\nmethodology into a textbook.\\nPrerequisites\\nThe book presents a calculus-based physics course which makes free use of algebra, trigonometry and\\nco-ordinate geometry. The level of the latter three topics is quite simple and high school mathematics is sufficient.Calculus is generally done at the introductory college level and I have assumed that the student is enrolled ina concurrent first calculus course. The relevant portions of calculus have been discussed in Chapter 2 so thatthe student may start using it from the beginning.\\nAlmost no knowledge of physics is a prerequisite. I have attempted to start each topic from the zero level.\\nA receptive mind is all that is needed to use this book.\\nBasic philosophy of the book\\nThe motto underlying the book is physics is enjoyable.\\nBeing a description of the nature around us, physics is our best friend from the day of our existence. I have\\nextensively used this aspect of physics to introduce the physical principles starting with common day occurrencesand examples. The subject then appears to be friendly and enjoyable. I have taken care that numerical valuesof different quantities used in problems correspond to real situations to further strengthen this approach.\\nTeaching and training\\nThe basic aim of physics teaching has been to let the student know and understand the principles and\\nequations of physics and their applications in real life.\\nHowever, to be able to use these principles and equations correctly in a given physical situation, one needs\\nfurther training. A large number of questions and solved and unsolved problems  are given for this purpose. Each\\nquestion or problem has a specific purpose. It may be there to bring out a subtle point which might have passedunnoticed while doing the text portion. It may be a further elaboration of a concept developed in the text. Itmay be there to make the student react when several concepts introduced in different chapters combine andshow up as a physical situation and so on. Such tools have been used to develop a culture: analyse the situation,\\nmake a strategy to invoke correct principles and work it out.\\nConventions\\nI have tried to use symbols, names, etc., which are popular nowadays. SI units have been consistently used\\nthroughout the book. SI prefixes such as micro, milli, mega, etc., are used whenever they make the presentation\\nmore readable. Thus, 20 µF is preferred over 20 × 10 − 6 F. Co-ordinate sign convention is used in geometrical\\noptics. Special emphasis has been given to dimensions of physical quantities. Numerical values of physicalquantities have been mentioned with the units even in equations to maintain dimensional consistency.\\nI have tried my best to keep errors out of this book. I shall be grateful to the readers who point out any\\nerrors and/or make other constructive suggestions.\\nH\\n C  V e r m a'"
