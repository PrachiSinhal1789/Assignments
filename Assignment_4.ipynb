    "\n",
    "Ans.This is an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the\n",

    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    For concatenation we can use extend,append,+\n",
    "    eg list1.append(list2),list1.extend(list2),list1=list1+list2\n",
    "    \n",
    "   For replication we can use list1.copy()\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.append() helps to add new list at the end of the existing list\n",
    "    insert() helps to add element at specified index\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: remove() and pop()\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Both list and string values have length and each element of string has index just like list elements have index\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Tuples are immutable and they use ()\n",
    "    lists are mutable and they use []\n",
    "    \n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:t=(42)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",

    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they\n",
    "contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Variables will contain reference to the list values or we can say they contain memory location where list values are stored\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:copy.copy() creates a new object which points or references towards the original object and changes made in new object is reflected in original object (valid for compound object i.e object containing object)\n",
    "copy.deepcopy() creates a new object and adds elements into it from the original object and changes in new object is not reflected in original object"
